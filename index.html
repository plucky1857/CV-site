                <p>I'm a learning game developer that likes creating games, just as much as playing them. My passion for creating games stems from a passion i've had for playing games since i was 6 years old. Making game mechanics and creating worlds that i've wanted to play for years is how i make my games come to life</p>
                <p>My personal interests lie in system design, gameplay programming, and creating player experiences that i myself and everyone else would enjoy. Im familiar with multiple game engines and various programming languages.</p>
